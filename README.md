Homework for Module 15 - Mapping


In this challenge, we take live data from the US Geological Survey to create a map of earthquake data.

My data is being fed from the "Past 7 Days" feed from the USGS which is updated every minute.

Additionally, I have added a layer showing the boundaries of the tectonic plates to better visualize the relationship with the mapped earthquakes.

Each circle on the map is a separate incident reported in the USGS data with pop-ups including meaningful data for each incident and a link to the official page for that incident.
